Reading questions due before class

What is recursion?
	-a method that calls itself
When learning recursion, what is the defacto “hello world” style program?
	def factorial num 
		if num < 0
			return 'You can\'t take the factorial of a negative number!' 
		end
		if num <= 1 
			1
		else
		    num * factorial(num-1)
		end 
	end
Use pseudo code to complete a recursive sort
Hint: There are three steps to any recursive algorithm
Check to see if there’s any work left to do and return if not. (early return)
Do some work (reduce the problem)
Call yourself (recurse) (sometimes 2 & 3 are the same step)

What does + do to a Time object?
	-Adds time to the object.
Explain what the epoch is. When does the epoch end? What happened to 30-year house loans in 2008?
	-Ruby thinks the world began at epoch: the stroke of midnight, January 1, 1970, GMT. I imagine the interest from before 1970 got added on.
How is a Hash different from an Array?
	-An array is basically an ordered list indexed starting from 0. A Hash is an unordered list indexed by user inputed assignments.
When using each on a Hash, will objects always come out in the correct order?	
	-No
What is a Range? How do you puts all the numbers from 0 to 26?
	num = (1..26)
	num_a = num.to_a
	puts num_a
What is the difference between Time.now.class and Time.class?
	-Time.now.class, Time is the class. With Time.class, Class is the class.
